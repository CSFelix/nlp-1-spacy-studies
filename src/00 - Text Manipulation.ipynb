They are differently from Structured Texts, so instead of having the term wrapper by signgs that tell the text must be formatted, the formatting rules are inserted into the binaries of the Document. Examples: Microsoft Word and Libre Office Writer files`;\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Structured Text** - `texts that may contain formatting for better visualzation, such as font sizes, bold, italic, images, tables, plots and much more. However, unlikely Rich Text, the terms should be wrapped by signs in order to tell the text must be formmated, so, we can say the rules are inserted into the text itself. Examples: HTML, XML, LaTeX and Markdown files`;\n",

This is the best type of text to work with NLP. Examples: TXT, CSV and CoNLL-U Files`.\n",

    "Besides, all texts must be encoded in order to be read by computers, that is, each character from the text must have a respective number representation of itself understood by the computer. This number representation can be a decimal, binary or hexadecimal, being the last one more common.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** - `it's the first well succeeded text encoding rule, representing the characters by one byte and the numerical representation goes from 0 to 127. Even though ASCII fits very well in English, it cannot be used in all texts since it does not encode characters with accentuation and some special characters available in other languages, for instance, Portuguese ('√∫', '√µ', '√™', '√ß' and '√†')`;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unicode** - `it has been created to solve the accentuation and special characters problem encountered when working with ASCII. It's been widely applied to encode a variety of texts nowadays, being able to encode more than 1,100,000.00 characters, such as letters, symbols and even emojis!! An important thing about Unicode is that it can be implemented in different rules accordingly to the target language, being 'UTF-8' the most general and used one. Just for curiosity, Unicode codes are from U+000000 to U+10FFFF, being the first two digits decimals, and the last four, hexadecimals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when dealing with a variety of texts and languages, it's recommended to work with `Plain Texts` encoded in `Unicode` format, more especifically in `UTF-8` rather than `UTF-16` and `UTF-32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, it's important to have in mind that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, so we can encode an ASCII text to UTF-8, but we cannot do the opposite."
